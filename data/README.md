# Real data sets

Here you can find the two real data sets (after preprocessing) we used in the "rPCor" paper. 

- `tcga_pan_ncrna_rnaseq.RData`: this is the TCGA Pan-kidney non-coding vs. gene expression data set. After loading it into R, "X" is the n*p matrix for non-coding data and "Y" is the n*q matrix for RNA-seq data. 
- `tcga_gbm_methyl_rnaseq.RData`: this is the TCGA GBM methylation vs. gene expression data set. After loading it into R, "X" is the n*p matrix for methylation data and "Y" is the n*q matrix for RNA-seq data.
